This project has been utilizing Google Colab.
In this directory you will find:

* The Colab notebook: notebook.ipynb
* Two datasets on csv format
    - overflow_export.csv
    - weather_station_export.csv
* This file, README.txt
* The project report: CS4020ProjectSpring24_<candidate_number>.pdf

How to use the notebook:
1. Upload the notebook to Google Colab
2. Upload the two csv files in the same directory
3. Run the notebook cell by cell (The first cell will install extra libraries)
    - The cells that perform gridsearch for hyperparameter tuning may take very long time, and should not be rerun unless absolutely necessary.
